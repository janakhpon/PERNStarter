                            Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.
                            It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.
                            Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,
                            looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur,
                            from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.
                             Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance.
                            The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

                            Heat oil in a (14- to 16-inch) paella pan or a large, deep skillet over medium-high
                            heat. Add chicken, shrimp and chorizo, and cook, stirring occasionally until lightly
                            browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer shrimp to a large plate and set aside, leaving chicken
                            and chorizo in the pan. Add piment√≥n, bay leaves, garlic, tomatoes, onion, salt and
                            pepper, and cook, stirring often until thickened and fragrant, about 10 minutes. Add
                            saffron broth and remaining 4 1/2 cups chicken broth; bring to a boil.
